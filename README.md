**Stef Bekaert** – Software Developer

&nbsp;

## 📌 About Me

I’m a software developer based in Belgium, who loves working on both the back and frontend. The main languages/frameworks I am working with currently are React and Flutter. I love building tools I would use myself and solving real-world problems with code. This portfolio showcases my work, contributions, and experiments.
